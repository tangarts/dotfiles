# You need to either copy the content of this file to your shell rc file
# (e.g. ~/.bashrc) or source this file directly:
#
#     LFCD="/path/to/lfcd.sh"
#     if [ -f "$LFCD" ]; then
#         source "$LFCD"
#     fi
#
# You may also like to assign a key to this command:
#
#     bind '"\C-o":"lfcd\C-m"'  # bash
#     bindkey -s '^o' 'lfcd\n'  # zsh
